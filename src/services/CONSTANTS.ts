/**
 * All API urls and other constants will reside here.
 * It is always a good idea to keep a local copy of all API response to
 * keep your app working for UI changes and
 * make it independent of network requirements.
 *
 * They need to be categorised and grouped together as:
 *  - Actual endpoints url.
 *  - Local data .json file path.
 * At a moment only one group should be uncommented.
 *
 * Other way to deal with this is to name every json file as per your service endpoint and use a basepath variable.
 * Toggle this basePath variable between "actual-domain.com/" or "/data/".
